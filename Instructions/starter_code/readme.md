The only trend I can see is that there are more cities with high humidity than cities with low humidity.  It doesn't seem to be affected by lattitude.  



## Cloudiness

On this day, it doesn't look like there is much cloud cover north and south of the equator.  From the 20th parallel up to the 70th.  And from -10 to -50.  



## Wind Speed
