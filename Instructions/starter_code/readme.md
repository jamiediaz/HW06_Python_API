# HW6 - WeatherPy

According to the first graph. 

(output_data/max_temp.png)

We can see that the highest temperatures are at the equator.  

In the humidity plot:

The only trend I can see is that there are more cities with high humidity than cities with low humidity.  It doesn't seem to be affected by lattitude.

On this day, it doesn't look like there is much cloud cover north and south of the equator.  From the 20th parallel up to the 70th.  And from -10 to -50.

In regards to wind speed, the world wasn't very windy that day.
